### What we do
Our idea is the creation of a website which will help people volunteering, thus contributing to the UN goals!
Users will be able either to contribute to already existing projects or to create new ones and gather volunteers for their implementation.
The website targets all layers of society: people, enterprises, non-profit organizations, etc.
More specifically, users will increase volunteering if they can find easily and quickly the right project to work on. Therefore, we will  allow people to meet, interact and work together on projects. In short, we animate the community and increase its dynamism towards a better future!
We also help companies valorizing the territory where they work and give them the possibility to manage and choose the best projects to finance. We give them the possibility to strengthen their public image in a greener and social way.
Non-profit organizations that rely on volunteering will increase their visibility and thus attract potential volunteers who are interested in promoting and participating in existing or new projects. This will make them work much faster and efficient!
Above all, we help the NU and humanity going a step closer to core milestones, the 2030 goals.
